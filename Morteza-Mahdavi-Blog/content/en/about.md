# About Me

I’m **Morteza**, an IT professional based in Germany, building a career around **reliable infrastructure and hands-on engineering**. I’m currently focused on strengthening my foundation in **Linux**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**, and turning that learning into visible, practical work through well-documented projects.

I learn by doing: setting up environments, breaking things safely, fixing them, and writing down the steps so they’re repeatable. On GitHub you’ll find my public learning repos such as **Docker-Mastery** and **Kubernetes-Mastery** where I document useful commands, concepts, troubleshooting notes, and small exercises that grow into real projects. 

My next step is combining these into a complete containerized application (frontend + backend + database) and deploying it into a Kubernetes cluster to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow.

I value structure, consistency, and clarity. I’m not chasing buzzwords.
I’m building skills that matter in real teams: clean setups, predictable processes, and documentation that makes life easier for others. I’m actively applying for IT roles and open to opportunities where I can contribute, learn quickly, and grow into greater responsibility.

If you’d like to collaborate, discuss a role, or give feedback on my projects, feel free to reach out.
